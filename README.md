# LilyGo EPD47 Image Receive And Display

This is a project to display image sent from Android phone on LilyGo 4.7inch e-paper display.

This is a fork.

- Modified the firmware a little
- Added ESPimage_sender.py to send images and URLs from a server

Todo:
- Amend firmware to load and process images on its own (unlikely as in not needed by myself)
- Use RTC to show time on button press und do partial refresh
